This is the home of the OpenScraping project.

Our goal is to provide an open and extensible [specification](./spec/definitions) for building scalable scraping systems. You may want to look at the [Architecture](./spec/architecture) page first, and then look at the definitions for specific components if necessary.

We also provide an reference scraping system along with a standard scraping client in the form of a browser extension.

The basic model of OpenScraping is you have a Scraper and a Client. The client submits a Scrape Definition to the scraper, which then goes about processing the job and collecting the relevant information.
