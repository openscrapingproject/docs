title: Output Data Format
---

The output data is characterized by zero or more matched page sets, one or more matched pages, and N keys that are defined in the Scraping definition.

## JSON Output

The following is a minimalist output format, but loses certain information.

```json
{
  "<pageSetID>": {
    "<url>": {
      "data": "result",
      "is": "structured"
    }
  }
}
```

First off, we highly recommend enriching the data with semantic information. All implementations SHOULD parse individual page scraping definitions, and output data, AND provide warnings if the data is not a properly structured JSON-LD document.

Additionally, production environments SHOULD throw an error if the result is not properly structured.

This allows for each page to be consumed by a system that can easily understand its context and place it directly into a knowledge graph.

## Example

Let's say our scraper retrieved this data:

```json
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "NewsArticle",
  "description": "A never-released report shows that the number of people killed by police activity in New York is more than twice what has been reported.",
  "headline": "Undercounting Those Killed by the N.Y.P.D.",
  "publisher": {
    "@id": "https://www.nytimes.com/#publisher"
  }
}
```

## Data Size and Visualization

import Mermaid from "../../src/theme/Mermaid";

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <Mermaid
    chart={`
graph TB
A[Root] --> B[Page Set 1]
B --> E & F & G & H
A --> C[Page Set 2]
C --> I & J & K & L & M
E --> N[attr 1] & O[attr 2] & P[... attr N]
A --> Z[... Page set PS]
`}
  />
</div>

This results in a total data size of:

$$
S = \sum_{n=1}^{PS} N_{i} \cdot P_{i}
$$

Where $PS$ is the number of Page Sets, $N_{i}$ is the number of Relevant Data attributes for set i, and $P_{i}$ is the number of pages for that set.

Generally, for a static Scraping Definition, only $P_{i}$ is subject to change based on new pages which may be posted and match a page set, or different slices of an offline dataset which the scraper looks at.
