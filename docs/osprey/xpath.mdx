title: A Journey through XPath Selectors
---

This document discusses XPath selectors and how they are visualized in the Osprey extension.

It's an innovative method that hopes to bring the power of these selectors to everyone, including non-technical folks.

## Basics

First off, there are four types of **nodes** in XPath. This is illustrated below:

<img src="/static/img/tree.png" />

Elements are able to be accessed through a number of **axes**. These are shown below:

<img src="/static/img/xpath-axes.jpg" />

There are also some other axes for accessing attributes, etc.

## Examples

We'll go through some examples, illustrating the selector text and the visual tree that it represents.

In the following examples: `...` indiciates the `descendant-or-self` axis.

### `child` Axis

```
//ul/li/a
//child::ul/child::li/child::a
```

import Mermaid from "../../src/theme/Mermaid";

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <Mermaid
    chart={`
graph TB
A[Root] --> B[...]
style B fill:#f9f
B --> C[ul]
C --> D[li]
D --> E[a]
`}
  />
</div>

### `descendant` Axis

```
//ul/li/a
//child::ul/child::li/child::a
```

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <Mermaid
    chart={`
graph TB
A[Root] --> B[...]
style B fill:#f9f
B --> C[ul]
C --> D[li]
D --> E[a]
`}
  />
</div>

## Conclusions

There's no good way to map the complexity of the above image of all the XPath Axes onto a simple nested tree structure that works as a React component.

Thus, we'll map the following:

- descendant, descendant or self, child - children of a node
- siblings - siblings of the node
- ancestor, etc - not supported immediately
